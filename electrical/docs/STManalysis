from the datasheet,(https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f446re.html) it appears that the stm can read a usb micro AB port using the PB 12-15 pins. This would hook up to the switch-connector. 

that it has usb is advertized in the description, so hopefully it won't need too much work to read usb messages.
page 22 talks about power for the usb

more on setup on page 37

this page discusses the pinouts of the micro-usb ab https://pinouts.ru/PortableDevices/micro_usb_pinout.shtml


it appears the usb controller needs a 48MHz oscillator and we currently have an 8MHz oscillator. I don't know if changing this will break anything. 

USB needs 3.3V, thankfully, this is already supplied

the datasheet doesn't say anything about the software. I'll have to loo somehere else
